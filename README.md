# Bamazon

## Overview

Bamazon is a Node.js and MySQL storefront application that has customer, manager, and supervisor level command line interfaces. Customers can place orders for products from different departments. Managers can monitor, view, create and modify product inventory. Supervisors can create entirely new departments and generate a report of product sales by department.

## Customer View

`node bamazonCustomer.js`

Customers can place orders for products. First, the user is presented with a full list of all products. When prompted, an item ID is to be entered, followed by a quantity for that item. If there is not enough stock, the user will be alerted, otherwise the total cost for the order is displayed.
